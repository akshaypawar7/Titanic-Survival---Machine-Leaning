# Titanic-Survival---Machine-Leaning
Explorating and visualising the data, trying to get some insights about our dataset, Building and tuning couple classification models to get some stable results on predicting Titanic disaster outcome.

# Inspiration
 Found below video on youtube https://youtu.be/fKo-kE587QA, showing classical classification algorithm(KNN, Decision Tree) at work in 3D space build from titanic paseenger training set.
